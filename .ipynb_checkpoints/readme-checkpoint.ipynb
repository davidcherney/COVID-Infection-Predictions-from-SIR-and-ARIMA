    "### Background\n",
    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average\">ARMIMA models</a> are a general tool for time series prediction that take into account past trends in a variety of ways. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model_without_vital_dynamics\">SIR models</a> by contrast, aim to model the dyanamics of spead of disease in a finite population. By comparing SIR and ARIMA models using national COVID-19 data from the CDC, we want to determine if SIR or ARIMA is a better predictor of new COVID-19 infections.\n",

    "- The data from [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36) had data on total number of people infected to date, a cumulative sum. However, for the SIR model, we needed the number of people infected _daily_. In order to get this data, we used the .diff() method on the column titled tot_cases and assigned the values to a I_actual column. We did a .diff(14) to reflect the number of days a person has an active COVID-19 infection.\n",

However, for the SIR model, we needed the number of people infected daily. We engineered this feature, we used the pandas .diff(14) method on the total infected column and assigned the values to a I_actual column under the assumption that COVID cases last 14 days.\n",

    "## Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "In our comparison of SIR and ARIMA models, SIR consistently overshoots the actual values. Therefore, we recommend that the Federal Department of Health use SIR more to shpw worst case scenarios, and use ARIMA for more accurate predicitions. The downside is that ARIMA's best predictions are short term. \n",
    "\n",
    "A possible reasons why SIR consistently overpredicts is because it does take take into account changes in behavior such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Social distancing\n",
    "- Remote work/school\n",
    "- Masking\n",
    "- Hand washing\n",
    "- Reduced travel\n",
    "- Closure of public places \n",
    "\n",
    "and other COVID-19 related precautions. These precautions very likely prevented the U.S. from reaching the infection numbers predicted by SIR. SIR also does not take into account how far apart populations are. For example, cities in rural parts of the country are less dense and therefore will have slower spread statewide comparitive to cities and states such as New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIR also does not account for variants in the virus which have different rates of transmission (R0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, SIR isn't the best for actual predictions. However, it is appropriate for predicting worst case scenarios. Next steps would include testing SIR models on time frames \"medium\" time frames such as 1 week, 1 month etc., and further attempting to adjust the SIR parameters to account for changes in behaviors.
